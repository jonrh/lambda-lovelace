This is a requested blog post by the module cordinators, it will cover:

* What are you building?
* What are the use cases?
* What data sources will you use?
* What technologies will you use?

### The Product
The project we are doing is a collaborative recommender system for tweets; a personalised tweet stream. The name of the product and our team is **λ Lovelace**.

A user with a Twitter account signs up to our services and uses our iOS mobile client. Tweets from followers not of interest (e.g. political rants) are filtered out (or deferred to later) while interesting tweets are prioritised in the timeline. Tweets from non-followers may be suggested as well. Essentially we hope to create a better, more personalised timeline of tweets than what Twitter provides by default. Our iOS app will make observations of the users engagements (opening, liking, time in focus, etc) and sends the information to the recommender back-end for further recommendations.

The mobile app is required in order to collect additional user preference information to refine the recommendations. For example, if a user clicks a link in a tweet, likes a tweet, retweets, or engages in conversations. Another potential passive observation mechanishm would be to have the client measure the amount of time a tweet is visible. Thinking being if a tweet is in focus for longer it might be of more interest than a tweet that is scrolled past quickly.

Our contributions or novelty if you will are as follows:

1. Filter out uninteresting tweets (or defer to later)
2. Collect additional user preferences in a mobile app
3. Show interesting tweets from non-followers

These are ordered by priority, that is we will first strive to implement tweet filtering, then data collection in the mobile app and if things go well we will try to introduce outsider tweets that might be of interest to the user.



### Use Cases
A typical use case is a Twitter power user. The user follows a lot of other accounts and the feed of tweets is owerwhelming on the home timeline. There is not enough time to read them all.

Take for example power user *Susan*. She is a software engineer and most of the accounts she follows on Twitter are programming or tech related. For the most part tweets are relevant but tweets about the general election in the USA are of no concern to Susan and therefore a waste of time. Same applies for other topics of tweets.

There are Twitter clients out there that allow user to mute or block certain words, hashtags, or other accounts. However over the long haul it's a lot of manual effort.



### Data Sources
Our only data source so far is the [Twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/). Other data sources may come later but as of now we suspect it will remain the only data source for the remainder of the project.


### Technology Stack
Below are some of the technical descisions we've made so far. Please note that we do not consider them binding. That is, we are fully prepared to switch languages, stacks mid project if we believe it will suit us better.

- **Mobile**: iOS 9 + Swift 2.2
- **Recommender System**: Python 3
- **Back-end web service**: Python 3 or 2, [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) (or [Bottle](http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/index.html))
- **Database**: Undecided. Maybe [PostGres](https://www.postgresql.org/), [Redis](http://redis.io/), or [RethinkDB](http://rethinkdb.com/).

For the backend we'll strive to use Python 3 as much as we can but for some parts it may be nescisary to use Python 2.7. For the recommender system we aim to use Python 3 data scicence libraries as much as we can. For example we have been using the library [Tweepy](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy) for interacting with the Twitter API via Python.

Python is not the fastest language on the block so we've pondered the possibility to dip into [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for performance critical parts if some gains are to be had. We'll see.

As for the database we have not entirely made up our mind. What comes to mind is PostGres for general storage. The Twitter API has pretty restrictive rate limits so it looks like we might need to store tweets ourselves. What comes to mind are some document databases like Redis or RethinkDb.

### Project Managment
In a [previous post](http://jonrh.github.io/lambda-lovelace/2016/05/26/project-managment-tool-selection/) we covered our approach to project managment. In summary we took a look at a lot of solutions and ended on [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.io/). ZenHub is a Chrome extension to augment the webpage of our GitHub repository to give us a Kanban board, story points on issues, epics, burndown charts, and more.
