# Feedback From Module Coordinators

This document contains feedback we have received from the module coordinators for various parts of the project.


## Project Plan

**Recieved**: 2016-06-15

Dear all,

Thank you for submitting your project plan report. Based on reviewing your plan, please find below feedback and an indicative grade. This grade does not count towards your overall module mark, but you should take it into account for improving your interim deliverables:

- The report is too vague and lacking detail. 
- Clearer user stories and workflows are required. For example, It could also be useful to define what a power user is for the purposes of your system, e.g., how many tweets does the user need on their timeline for the recommendation to work well?
- Little detail on the recommender, for example clearly state the training set, and the pool of tweets that will be used to generate recommendations and how these recommendations ultimately affect the user's timeline in the app? 
- Wire-frames / mock-ups for the MVP app would be helpful. 
- Think about what do you aim to learn from implementing the MVP 
- Be areful of using technical terms out of context without any definition, what do you mean by "case-based recommendation",  "bounded greedy algorithm", and "evaluation of the Recommender System should be largely manual, but it may be possible to automate some of the results using a bag-of-words approach to testing"?
- Evaluation plan is nice. Asking participants to order lists of 10 tweets is a  nice idea but might be hard to do in any volume in practice. Presenting sets of tweets to users and asking them to pick the most relevant set might be a better approach.
- It looks like you are well set up for the project and working together in-person so much is a good idea. 

Grade: B-

Regards,  
Brian.

## First Blog Post and Show & Tell

**Recieved**: 2016-06-02

Dear all,

Based on reviewing your blog post and presentation, and from our discussions during the team sessions on Tuesday, these are some recommendations that might help with your project:

- Refine the user story scenarios and avenues to gather user feedback (deal with cold-start).
- Separate the initial recommedations from subsequent in-app feedback.
- Will in-app personalisation be based on positive feedback (likes, retweets) or negative feedback ("some me less of this", "thumbs down").
- Read the AnthusNews report about related problem.
- Investigate existing tools that you can use to solve this problem (what are their pitfalls)?
- How does your system compare to Twitter personalization?
- What can you try to do better (check http://algorithmwatch.org/)?
- Good you structured the work into components ranked by priority. How will you evaluate each component?
- Consider using multiple Twitter accounts and the StreamingAPI to deal with Twitter rate limits.

Regards,  
Brian.
