# λ Lovelace

**Project Summary**A collaborative recommender system for tweets. A user with a Twitter account signs up and uses our iOS mobile client. Tweets from followers not of interest are filtered out (or deferred to later) while interesting tweets are prioritised. Tweets from non-followers may be suggested. The iOS client makes observations of the users engagements (opening, liking, time in focus, etc) and sends it to the recommender back-end for further formulation of recommendations.
