# Î» Lovelace - Archive

This folder is an archive containing legacy code for both the API and Recommender System. This code left here for the sake of keeping old functionality if it needed in the future. This code should absolutely not be updated. All updates should be made in the "backend" folder, where we keep code that is put into production.
